## possible improvements


1. Interstate the launcher with the game more. This would enable the launcher to show who is logged in, what level they are the monsters thay have trained etc. 
2. Enable retrieval of blog posts from an api source, this would mean not having to build a new launcher each tim Le a blog post was created. 
3. Enable purchasing of mexh direct from the launcher. 
4. Add the functionality to chat to friends and guild mates. 
5. Convert the system to use micro front ends, this would add to the stability of the launcher.
